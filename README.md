# GPT-2 Python Implementation

**Read the paper. Watched Karpathy. Got inspired. Rewrote it in Python, my way.**

This repository contains my personal implementation of the **GPT-2** model. While GPT-2 wasn't the first, it's the model that sparked a wave of innovation and excitement around generative language models. This is my take on the groundbreaking architecture that started it all.
